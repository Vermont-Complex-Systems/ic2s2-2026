					With views across Lake Champlain to the Adirondack Mountains in the west and the Green Mountains in the east, the University of Vermont campus is a beautiful location nestled in downtown Burlington, Vermont. The city is a locus of year-round outdoor activities, and a vibrant local food and small farm movement. While perhaps best known for fall foliage and winter skiing and snowboarding, summer in Vermont features beautiful summer weather, including swimming at local beaches, sailing and a lakefront bike path. Conference participants will be well served by restaurants and bars in Burlington's downtown area. Activities such as hiking, biking (the Colchester Causeway stretching nearly four miles out into Lake Champlain toward the islands north of Burlington is very rewarding), kayaking, and touring the countryside and the many nearby mountains (Stowe and the Von Trapp Family Lodge are just 45 minutes away, the magical Northeast Kingdom just a little further) will all be available. With James Beard award winning and nominated fine dining, waterfront eateries, local breweries, comedy and jazz venues, and endless outdoor activities, Burlington is a hidden gem and a memorable place to visit.
